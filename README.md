# SE333
This repository contains all the work that I did on the final project for my software testing class at Depaul University with Daniel Walker. 
It contains many documents including the Readiness Report, Static Analysis, and Coverage Analysis.
It also contains the test code that I wrote including the boundary, equivalence partioning, and Mockito tests on various classes from the source code. 
None of the professor's (source) code is included in this repository.
