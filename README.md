# SE333
This repository contains all the original work that I did on the final project for my software testing class at Depaul University with Daniel Walker. 
It contains many documents including the Readiness Report, Static Analysis, Boundary and Equivalence Partioning tests and Coverage Analysis. Also included are the Jacoco reports that go with the coverage analysis document. 
It also contains the test code that I wrote including the boundary, equivalence partioning, and Mockito tests on various classes from the source code. 
None of the professor's (source) code is included in this repository.
